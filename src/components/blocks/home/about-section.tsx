        This is my humble internet abode, where I sometimes <Anchor href="/blog">blog</Anchor> about
        programming, software development, game development, and some 3D modeling in my daily work.

        As a supporter of open source, I believe that sharing knowledge and collaborating on
        projects is essential for the advancement of technologies.
